== HdfTimeStrip ==
Developed by Fredrik Orderud, 2009.

Command-line utility to strip time-stamp information from HDF5 files, so HDF5 files of identical content become binary duplicates.

== Dependencies ==
The HDF5 library 1.8 or newer.
Environment variable: RCTL_HDF.

Windows tip: Buid HdfTimeStrip against static HDF5 libraries to avoid any DLL dependencies.
